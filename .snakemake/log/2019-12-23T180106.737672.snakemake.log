rule fastqcScore:
    input: s4FastQC/r1_fastqc.zip, s4FastQC/r2_fastqc.zip
    output: s4FastQC/r1_fastqc, s4FastQC/r2_fastqc, tbl1, tbl2
    jobid: 1

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 139 of /home/xinyut/workflows/16s-pipeline/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
tbl1
tbl2
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job fastqcScore since they might be corrupted:
s4FastQC/r1_fastqc, s4FastQC/r2_fastqc
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
